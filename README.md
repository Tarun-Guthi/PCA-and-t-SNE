# PCA-and-t-SNE


In this repository I'm implemented dimensionality reduction techniques called PCA and tSNE on MNIST dataset. 

[You can download the dataset from here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)

I implemented PCA from scratch and then I used sklearn implementation of PCA. Both were given the same results.

Here, I'm  reducing 784 dimensional data to 2 dimensional data.
The code is explained in the notebook itself.
